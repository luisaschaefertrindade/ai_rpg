# Noir RPG built with Streamlit and Gemini

Step into the shoes of a young and motivated journalist in a rain-soaked city full of secrets and corruption.

This is a procedural text-based RPG powered by [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) and built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). The AI acts as the noir-style Dungeon Master, responding to your typed actions with gritty narrative and consequence — with dice rolls deciding your fate.

---

## How it works

- You type what you want to do, like:
  > “I tail the suspect down the alley.”
- A d20 is rolled to see if your action succeeds.
- The AI narrates the result in classic noir style.
- Your character has HP and an inventory, visible in the sidebar.
- Every decision shapes your story.

## Example prompt

> *“I flick my cigarette and step into the diner, eyes scanning the room for trouble.”*

📜 *DM:*
*The bell above the door tings like a warning shot. Greasy booths, tired eyes, and one face that doesn’t belong... Trouble’s already here, and it’s wearing red lipstick.*
